            <h2>Early History</h2>
            <p>The area that is now Mumbai was originally an archipelago of seven islands inhabited by Koli fishermen. Archaeological findings suggest human habitation dating back to the Stone Age. The islands were part of several indigenous empires, including the Maurya, Chalukya, and Rashtrakuta dynasties.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
            <p>The Portuguese were the first Europeans to establish control over the islands in the 16th century. In 1661, they were transferred to the British as part of Catherine of Braganza's dowry when she married Charles II of England. The British East India Company developed Bombay into a major seaport and commercial center.</p>
