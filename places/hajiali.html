            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Haji Ali Dargah was built in the early 15th century by a wealthy merchant named Haji Ali, who was said to have been on a pilgrimage to Mecca when he died. His remains were brought back to Mumbai, and the dargah was constructed in his honor. It has since become a significant site for both Muslim and non-Muslim devotees.</p>
