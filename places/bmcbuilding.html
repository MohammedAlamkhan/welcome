            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The BMC Building was completed in 1893, designed by architect Frederick William Stevens, who also designed the nearby Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. The building was constructed in the Gothic Revival style, reflecting the architectural trends of the British colonial era. It has since become a symbol of Mumbai's municipal governance and heritage.</p>
